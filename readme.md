To Do
=====
- Try feeding larger image (1024 x 1024) with mulitple grass patches
- Visualise weights as the NN trains
- Visualise activations for individual images
  - Use t-SNE on activations
- Deeper architecture
- Real data
- Different models for checking output
  - Iage output reproduces image input via a bottleneck layer
  - Compare two points within different categories and measure vector difference
  - Allow NN to model into two categories
