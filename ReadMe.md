To Do
=====
- Try feeding larger image (1024 x 1024) with mulitple grass patches: DONE

- Interpret nn_run.py output, e.g use OpenCV to count "blobs" of grass.
- Use real data to train nn_train.py.

- Visualise weights as the NN trains
- Visualise activations for individual images
  - Use t-SNE on activations
- Deeper architecture
- Real data
- Different models for checking output
  - Image output reproduces image input via a bottleneck layer
  - Compare two points within different categories and measure vector difference
  - Allow NN to model into two categories
